            '10 lumins are deposited to start or join a Spark.',

        'question': 'What if I run out of lumins?',
        'answer': "You can still browse the map, but you'll need available lumins to join or start a Spark. Lumins held for a Spark are released after your attendance is confirmed or if the Spark auto-cancels. Purchasing more lumins isn't available yet, but it's a coming soon."

    {
        'question': 'Why are faces hidden first?',
        'answer': 'To protect privacy and reduce snap judgments, profiles stay private until you join. Photos become visible to your group shortly before the Spark begins and are never visible outside your Spark.'

    {
        'question': 'Is this app safe?',
        'answer': 'Safety is built in. Members pass a live selfie check, Sparks are at public venues, and faces reveal only to your group right before start. We use your location selely to confirm attendance and never share it with other users. If anything feels off, leave and report it in the app.'
    },
    {
        'question': 'What if my Spark drops below the minimum group size I wanted?',
        'answer': 'If your Spark drops below your minimum group size, you will have 15 minutes to confirm you are still in. if you do not confirm, you will be removed and your lumins will be refunded.'
